        <div class="content">
          <p>
              Our website is split into different components, which is imported into the same document.
              This made it easy to delegate the workload, and allowed us to work simultaneously on the same main page via GitHub.
              We stuck to original plan (as detailed in P2), working on seperate components (style and markup).
              Guri worked on the contact component. This included implementing Apple MapKit JS.
              After developing the simple component framework (See modularity), 
              Imre worked on the navbar. He also helped Morten with the header component and mentored most of the component styles,
              after working on the global stylesheet.
              Morten worked on the about and the header components.
              Emil did some fine work on the menu.

          <h3>Map and contact changes</h3>
          <p>
            While working on the map and contact page the map felt a little
            small since the restaurants position on the map is so far off from
            the nearest city. Therefore it was decided to put the map and
            contact under eachother so it would be easier for the user to look
            at and use the map. It also made more sense to give the map a darker
            theme to match the rest of the page and not stick out like a sore
            thumb. The styling of the contacts got a little pop of color to not
            look so flat and tie it in with the general cholorscheme of the rest
            of the mainpage.
          </p>
          <h3>Menu changes</h3>
          <p>
            The menu remained mostly the same as in P2 with the exception of 
            color changes for the fonts of the headers. Also we decided to increase
            the distance between the gray lines seperaiting categories on the menu
            to give it a more refined look.

          <p>
            How each of the team members fulfilled their minimum requirements.
            For example: Rachel fulfilled her JavaScript requirements with a
            user-defined function on intro.html and rollovers on members.html.
            Tom validated form inputs on orform.html and implemented the
            pull-down menu for each page. <br /><br />
            Guri implemented the map for Apple maps, using Apples Mapkit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Imre implemented the navbar and header components, aswell as the global styles. 
            After setting up the component import framework, Imre also helped with most of the final components styles.
            He also provided the Apple Developer access for Mapkit JS.
          </p>
          <p>
            Emil implemented the menu aswell as the css and javascript for it.

        <h2 class="header"><span class="bold">6 </span> Modularity</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
              Imre was responsible for handling the modularity of the site. 
              To acheive modularity we split up the page into seperate, independent components that we could each work on independently.
              This allowed us to work on the same page in parallell through GitHub.
              Imre set up a simple JavaScript framework for importing the components to the main index.html.
              Originally this framework would import a components markup aswell as its style, but we decided to instead use CSS import statements in the production build,
              to ensure the styles would be ready and loaded when the page loads. It also cleaned up the code in the developer console of chrome.
