                        A description of your efforts to reach testers that are similar to the
                        website's intended audience and how successful you were (give the percentages of
                        your tester audience once you aggregate their answers, e.g., 23% of college
                        students, 46% school administrators, etc.) If you are collecting age-ranges, you can
                        do the same. If you were able to do live testing with a few users, describe that as
                        well.

                        Step back and reflect on the whole project experience and what you
                        learned from it. Are there general lessons that you learned, beyond the
                        nuts-and-bolts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? We would like you to take this
                        seriously and be thoughtful about your comments, but there is no right or wrong
                        answer here, so don't feel that you have to flatter us or try to divine what we want to
                        hear.
