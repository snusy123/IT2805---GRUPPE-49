                        The google form: In our questionnaire we started of by asking our respondent some questions in an effort to screen our participants, chiefly question 1-4. 
                        In our screening we wanted to clarify certain aspects of the respondent mainly in regard to his/her experience browsing the web. 
                        The following questions are more important as they give actual feedback as to how the respondent experienced the website. 
                        We provide four questions where to respondent chooses one of five numbers expressing their experience. 
                        Finally, we gave the respondent the oppertunity to tell us what kind of device they used when browsing the website and what browser, followed by a text-field where the respondent can provide a more detailed feedback if so desired. 
                        The two latter questions were not required, as we did not want to force our respondents to provide written feedback.

                        In in our quest for respondents within our clients desired customer group, we opted for an approach in which we shared the form on various social platforms like Facebook, 
                        with people we know ourselves to be qualify as probable users in the future. This approach yielded decent results as we were able to get 22 responders. 
                        As far as responses are concerned, the result are as follows:

                        Our website was exposed to several devices and browsers, the fact that our website seemingly worked quite well as can be seen from the results of the questionnaire. 
                        We were exposed to devices like iphone, Samsung Galaxy, Huawei p30, Mac, PC, s and ipad's, and browsers such as chrome, safari, edge and explorer. 
                        All in all, our site was tested on many of the most popular platforms and fared quite well, hence we can with resonable confidence conclude that our site performs well on the most important platforms.

                        Step back and reflect on the whole project experience and what you
                        learned from it. Are there general lessons that you learned, beyond the
                        nuts-and-bolts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? We would like you to take this
                        seriously and be thoughtful about your comments, but there is no right or wrong
                        answer here, so don't feel that you have to flatter us or try to divine what we want to
